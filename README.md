# PublicHealthExpediture
Comparison of government expenditure between several countries.
I have downloaded the government expenditure on health for multiple countries from the OECD's website, organized by public health expenditure by country. Using SQLite I converted all currencies to euros. After that I plotted a chart on Excel with the data series of the evolution of governemnet expenditure on health per citizen in each of the countries.

It is interesting to point out that the country that lead the expenditures on health until the year of 2018 was the USA, that despite having the largest GDP in the world does not
have a public health system.

* I have removed the data from Hungary from the results, because they were not consistent with the data found on any other founts.
